Blockchain technology is thriving and everybody is trying to get into the train and fast-track to build their own product with it.

With Bitcoin in 2009 the Blockchain approach had first seen its biggest audience. But its core idea isn't new.

In 2001 when I was a kid, my mom used to send me to the shop and buy some bread. I remember it was so fresh and smelled so good that I often started chipping it on my way home.

Someone had told me that in order to utilize yesterday's leftovers and save on ingredients, state bakeries would mash it up and put old breadcrumbs into the next batch.

Bingo!

Isn't that a Blockchain? Oh, pardon me, **Bakechain**!

The next batch will have some ingredients from today's inside, and bread I would buy today would have had some yesterday's ingredients in it and so on.

Every loaf of bread had ingredients that had been prepared for years.

While the analogy may seem dumb, I found it kind of fun I brought it up and put it into such a wild perspective.

What is your Blockchain analogy?
